    <p>
      Now this is a story all about how<br />
      My life got flipped-turned upside down<br />
      And I'd like to take a minute<br />
      Just sit right there<br />
      I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In west Philadelphia born and raised<br />
      On the playground was where I spent most of my days<br />
      Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br />
      And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school<br />
      When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br />
      Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br />
      I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br />
      She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br />
      But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way<br />
      She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.<br />
      I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it."<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      First class, yo, this is bad<br />
      Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.<br />
      Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?<br />
      Hmm, this might be alright.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that<br />
      Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?<br />
      I don't think so<br />
      I'll see when I get there<br />
      I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the plane landed and when I came out<br />
      There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out<br />
      I ain't trying to get arrested yet<br />
      I just got here<br />
      I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br />
      The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror<br />
      If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br />
      But I thought, "Nah, forget it."<br />
      â€“ "Yo, home to Bel-Air."<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br />
      And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later."<br />
      I looked at my kingdom<br />
      I was finally there<br />
      To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air<br />
