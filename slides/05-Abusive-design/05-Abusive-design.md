# DART 450 | Web Intervention | Week 05
## Abusive design

---

class:middle
## abusive game design is, at its core, about .codeHighlight[spotlighting the dialogic relation between player and designer].

???

- Does this make sense to us?
- Can an interactive system genuinely serve as a proxy for a human?


---

class:middle
## the hope is that .codeHighlight[players are forced out of their expectations] and into an experience in which the importance of understanding the game system is eclipsed by that of .codeHighlight[understanding the designer behind the system].

???


- Much of this design approach has a __focus on breaking down convention__, in order to create a new relationship between player and game (and designer).
- Fits well with the idea of a __personal webpage as intervention__.
- Perhaps in this context rather than try to create interactions that are metaphorically about the designer one could try to create something ambiguous/abusive in such a way that there is a __desire to understand the person behind the system__…

## By and large, game design theorists have positioned .codeHighlight[game design as the craft of satisfying players’ desires]

???

- Is this also true of the web? Is it about satisfying the audience? What is it about?
- Do we efface ourselves when we create our design work? Are we trying to hide ourselves? Why might this be desirable? What happens if we move in the other direction and foreground ourselves?
- How does this relate to social media and the idea of projecting ourselves through those interfaces?

## .codeHighlight[Player narcissism] is an extreme but inevitable consequence of user-centered design practices

## this current trend represents an .codeHighlight[intrinsic conservatism in the exploration of the medium and its aesthetic possibilities]

???

- Is this true of web design more generally? __Web user narcissism__?
- Key to see that there’s not __necessarily anything wrong with the developed conventional stance__
- But it is a __limitation of a much larger design space__ that we, as artist-designers, ought to explore.

## Physical Abuse: Painstation

- How does this form of abuse make us feel?
- Does this lead us into conversation with the designer?
- I wonder whether these forms of abusive designer really exist more as a form of __conversation with design itself__ rather than a specific designer?
- They allow us to ask why is this game this way? What does it mean?

- __How could this transfer to the web? Can we cause pain?__
- Should we?

## Digital (Physical) Abuse: Lose/Lose

???

- How does this form of abuse make us feel?
- Does this lead us into conversation with the designer?
- This plays into some of our greatest fears about computers - that just as they give us so much (data, interactivity, connectivity) - they could take it away!
- How could this transfer to the web?
- Difficult, right, because security measures make it a challenge to impact a user’s computer…
- Could try to crash it with an infinite loop, but it’s all sandboxed…

## Unfair Design: Kaizo Mario

???

- https://youtu.be/r86NLwCYXfk?t=48
- What about this seems conversational/dialogic?
- How does this form of abuse lead us to feel?
- This seems to me the strongest example of abuse and conversation?
- Importantly it’s systemic and it’s very literally a game created to be a dialogue in the first place.
- How could this transfer to the web?

## Aesthetic Abuse: Memories of a Broken Dimension

![](images/memoriesofabrokendimension.png)

???

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nptXAYlRhFo
- How does this kind of design make us feel? What is the abuse?
- Does this seem dialogic?
- Do we buy the idea that aesthetic abuse can lead us to a sense of dialog with the designer?
(I’m skeptical!)
- To me when we play with aesthetics in this way we’re leaning more toward narrative ideas that remain within the game itself? Can aesthetics (visual or otherwise) reach beyond the world/narrative they frame?
- How could this transfer to the web?

## Social Abuse: Dark Room Sex Game

![](images/darkroomsexgame.png)

???

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFd5DFxKfG8
- What about this seems conversational/dialogic?
- How does this form of abuse lead us to feel?
- Is this a conversation with the designer or with one’s partner?
- With the larger audience?
- Could this apply to the web?
- What about this idea of performative interaction we have here?
- It’s play designed to be witnessed and experienced socially in physical space…
- See also this idea of synergies of abuse - any given category here isn’t totalising, it’s a possible strategy that could be combined with others.
