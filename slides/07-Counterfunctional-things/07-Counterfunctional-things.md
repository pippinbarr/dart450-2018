# DART 450 | Web Intervention | Week 07
## Counterfunctional things

???

- Pierce, James and Paulos, Eric (2014). Counterfunctional Things. Proceedings of the 2014 conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS).
- DIS is a really worthwhile conference to look up if you’re interested in interaction design.

### .hi[Counterfunctional thing]
### a thing that figuratively counters some of its own “essential functionality”.

???

- “Designing digital technologies around extreme functional limitations can be a valuable source of new positive possibilities.”
- So in large part this is almost like a formal experimental design (a little like Oulipo?) where you decide to design ‘against the grain’ as it is perceived conventionally,
- with the expectation that you might therefore come across unexpected design possibilities
- “Functional opposition can to work to make what is familiar bizarre, surprising and amusing.”
- Distancing ourselves from convention and automatic responses can help us to see technology (or any design object in a new light)

### .hi[Golosimetro] by Paolo Ulian

???

- “Counterfunctional chocolate”?
- It seems to negate/complicate the pleasure of eating chocolate by carefully metering how much you’ve consumed, raising the spectre of diets.
- Can we come up with a related idea for the web?
- Seems most connected to ideas around (over)consumption of web content?
- Would it be helpful to be made aware of our consumption more explicitly?
- There are tools that check these sorts of things, or offer to limit us…
- The idea of the quantified self has been popular for a while (but not how the chocolate could be read as critical of the act of quantification itself potentially? In its absurdity?)

### .hi[CCD-Me-Not Umbrella] by Creative Capital

???

- http://survival.sentientcity.net/blog/?page_id=17
- “Functional opposition can also work to make what is familiar problematic.”
- In this case we have a piece of technology (the umbrella) that is counter to the functioning of another technology (CCD camera monitoring).
- What does the umbrella do, conceptually?
- Importantly, the existence of the umbrella immediately raising questions about the existence of the CCD monitoring - it draws attention to something that is often otherwise invisible.

- “we propose counterfunctionality as a way of both interpreting existing artifacts and approaching the design of new things.”
- This is their schema for design ideation in this context.
- that final step is really important in terms of identifying a positive/interesting change beyond the brute fact of limitation. Counterfunction isn't just dysfunction.
- Also note how in the paper they emphasise multiple interpretations. e.g. for the cameras: playful and amusing … critique of dominance of high-resolution imagery … facilitators of new practices and experiences …
- “we found it easier to avoid a strong critical or problemitizing stance as compared with designing counterfunctional email or wireless routers.”
- A rationale for choosing cameras specifically. Can be very easy to go all out with criticism of the status quo (or defence of it), harder to strike a more nuanced stance.

### .hi[Ultra-low resolution cameras] by James Pierce and Eric Paulos

???

- “underlying idea was to design in the opposing direction of the trend toward higher-resolution displays. Our aim was to explore interesting and possibly useful forms that might emerge based on this opposition.”
- __Note the openness they start out with - not a specific critique of HD cameras, but rather a desire to push in the other direction to see what might happen__
- __Q What does the idea of low resolution do?__
- (New forms of aesthetic, critical of the requirement for every greater resolution, smaller file sizes, require greater interpretation, …)
- “One application concept that emerged with these experiments was a series of “Pixelated Telepresence” devices that could preserve privacy while providing a playful and provocative portal into another location.”
- __Note how in working freely with a specifically technological idea (resolution) they end up finding their way toward a more designerly concept around social interaction…__
- __Q is there some sense in which we could talk about a “low resolution” website? Or some similar idea of reduction?__
(Fits in with ideas around being overwhelmed by the internet perhaps? Fits into debates around tools that do everything versus tools that do just one thing?)

### .hi[Inaccessible camera] by James Pierce and Eric Paulos

???

- This one is made of concrete and you smash it to get access to the internals in order to access the digital images
- __What do we think of it?__

- __Q Could this idea of actively destroying something to gain access translate to the web?__
- __Q How would we make it?__

- They also hypothesised a version where it’s simply impossible to access the data at all. What does this do to the experience of the camera?

- __Q Again, possible to think about this in the context of the web?__
  - (This is something I tackled in my game v r 2)

### .hi[Reverse Polaroid Camera] by James Pierce and Eric Paulos

???

- A camera that degrades the image every time you look at it, until it becomes a single pixel.
- Somewhat based on actual __theories of memory__? The idea that recalling something distorts it. https://www.technologyreview.com/s/515981/repairing-bad-memories/
- __Q What does this do in terms of experience?__
- __Gets at the larger concept of entropy__, which is almost denied by the basic idea of a user interface and the digital is interesting too? There’s a sense in which computer interface project a kind of timelessness and separation from physical decay…
- __Q Could we do something with entropy and the web?__
  - (A website that decays? That is disrupted by use? That fades?)
- (And of course __entropy does act on all technologies__ and causes them to be die out over time.)
- “The Reverse Polaroid seems to counter what lies at the essence of photography: visually capturing something so it can remain to be seen. ... Compared to other counterfunctional cameras, the Reverse Polaroid also does not counter functionality so as to readily recall older photographic technologies and experiences.”
- Interesting discussion of how __they themselves found the camera conceptually alluring__, but the people they talked with hated it.
- Part of their hypothesis for why is that it __doesn’t fit into a nostalgic view of technology__

### .hi[Prompt Camera] by James Pierce and Eric Paulos

???

- Prompt Camera (image is not of the actual prototype, it’s “the pocket square camera”)
- A camera that turns on a light at random times telling you it’s time to take a photograph
- __Q What would the experience be here?__
- Interesting for __structuring the activity of photography itself__ - fixing it in time and presumably asking you to notice/care about the visual composition of unexpected moments…
- __Q Can we use the web to structure activity? How?__

### Interesting to .hi[use]
### vs.
### Interesting to .hi[think about]

???

- This particularly comes up because of the Reverse Polaroid camera - the researchers thought it would be interesting, but participants didn’t.
- __It’s a larger tension we face with experimental interaction design work__
- does it make a difference whether we make the thing itself, or is the idea the creation? Robert Yang, a game designer, talks about games that are just as effective to “hear about” as to play…
- __Q Is it possible that people are just wrong about what would be interesting to use?__
- Generally speaking, the people in the study didn't actually get to use the devices
- Should we assume they are able to imagine the experience?
