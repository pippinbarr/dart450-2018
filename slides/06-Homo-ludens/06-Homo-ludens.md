### .hi[As computing has emerged from the office and laboratory, it seems to have brought along values of the workplace]: concerns for clarity, efficiency and productivity; a preoccupation with finding solutions to problems.

???

- Importantly, computers were created initially for science (including military) and then transitioned to being for work
- The idea was always about their ability to make us more _productive_

### It is as if they mirror .hi[only the ethnographic view that ordinary life requires work to achieve], and neglect the joyful, poetic, and spiritually rewarding nature of the lives we might find.

???

- This fixation on productivity no longer strictly matches the position of computation in our daily lives - it's everywhere and involved in every aspect of what we do at this point
- So does it really make sense to maintain these values of efficiency, productivity, etc. in these other contexts?
- Does it seem to "make sense" because it fits the highly capitalistic and protestant idea of work being the defining feature of life and virtue?

### "Play is not just mindless entertainment, but an essential way of engaging with and learning about our world and ourselves — for adults as well as children."

???

- The dictionary: "engage in activity for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious or practical purpose."
- Gaver: "As we toy with things and ideas, as we chat and daydream, we find new perspectives and new ways to create, new ambitions, relationships, and ideals. Play goes well beyond entertainment: it’s a serious business."
- This is a much broader understand of play, but congruent with areas like studies of animal play, where it is used explicitly for learning
